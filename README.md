# ALEXA-INTERFACE-ROBOTIC-WITH-DIGITAL-TWIN-IMPLEMENTATION
This project involves robotic arm, controlled via Alexa using the Robot Operating System (ROS). The project involved setting up ROS, integrating sensors and actuators, and programming the arm to grasp objects and respond to voice commands. This hands-on project demonstrated my skills in robotics, programming, and practical application.
